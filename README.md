# ARPABET-PhoneticTranscriptionJS
Microsoft Copilot generated Javascript algorithm which separates a word into its phonetic ARPABET spellings.

Here I can provide a basic algorithm in JavaScript that separates words into phonetic spellings. However, please note that this is a simplified version and may not cover all the complexities of English phonetics. 

```javascript
// Define the ARPABET phonetic associations
const arpabet = {
    'vowels': {
        'front': ['IY', 'IH', 'EH', 'EY', 'AE'],
        'back': ['AA', 'AO', 'OW', 'UH', 'UW'],
        'mid': ['ER', 'AX', 'AH'],
        'diphthongs': ['AY', 'AW', 'OY', 'IX']
    },
    'stopConsonants': {
        'voiced': ['B', 'D', 'G'],
        'unvoiced': ['P', 'T', 'K']
    },
    'fricatives': {
        'voiced': ['V', 'DH'],
        'unvoiced': ['F', 'TH', 'S', 'SH']
    },
    'semivowels': {
        'liquid': ['L', 'EL', 'R'],
        'glides': ['W', 'WH', 'Y']
    },
    'nasals': {
        'non_vocalic': ['M', 'N', 'NX'],
        'vocalic': ['EM', 'EN']
    },
    'affricates': {
        'voiced': ['CH', 'JH']
    },
    'other': {
        'whisper': ['HH'],
        'vocalic': ['DX'],
        'pause_or_glottal_stop': ['Q']
    }
};

// Function to separate words into phonetic spellings //
function separateIntoPhonetics(word) {
    let syllable = '';
    let phonetics = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        syllable += word[i].toUpperCase();
        for (let category in arpabet) {
            for (let subcategory in arpabet[category]) {
                for (let spelling of arpabet[category][subcategory]) {
                  if(syllable && spelling.match(new RegExp(`^${syllable}.*`))){
                    phonetics.push(spelling);
                    syllable = '';
                    break;
                  }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return phonetics;
}

// Test the function
console.log(separateIntoPhonetics('hello')); // Array ["HH, "EH", "L", "L", "OW"]
```

This function will take a word as input and return an array of phonetic spellings based on the ARPABET associations. Please note that this is a very basic implementation and does not account for all the complexities of English phonetics. For a more accurate phonetic transcription, you might want to use a dedicated library or API that has been specifically designed for this purpose. Also, this function assumes that the input word is spelled phonetically, which is not always the case in English. For example, the word 'hello' would be spelled 'helo' in a phonetic spelling. This function does not handle such cases. It simply maps each letter in the input word to its corresponding ARPABET phonetic spelling, if one exists. If a letter does not have a corresponding ARPABET phonetic spelling, it is ignored. This function also does not handle diphthongs or other multi-letter phonetic spellings. It treats each letter in the input word as a separate phonetic unit. This is a simplification and may not accurately reflect the actual pronunciation of the word. For a more accurate phonetic transcription, you might want to use a dedicated library or API that has been specifically designed for this purpose. This function is intended as a starting point and may need to be modified or extended to meet your specific needs.
